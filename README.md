## Overview

Responsive four-card feature section built using semantic HTML and modern CSS. The layout is mobile-first and adapts to larger screens using CSS Grid and Flexbox so each card displays neatly on both small and wide viewports.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See readable typography and accessible color contrast
- Have images/icons aligned consistently with card content

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5
- CSS custom properties (variables)
- Flexbox for card layout and alignment
- CSS Grid for the card grid on wide viewports
- Mobile-first responsive approach

### What I learned

- How to build a compact, responsive card grid using a mobile-first workflow.
- Using `clamp()` and responsive font sizing to improve legibility across viewports.


### Continued development

- Improve accessibility (ARIA attributes where appropriate, keyboard focus states).
- Add subtle micro-interactions (hover/focus states) and smooth image reveal animations.
- Add unit or visual regression tests for critical layout breakpoints.
